# nao-classroom

## Description
This is a set of python scripts to allow the Nao robot to teach a small python class with the help of the Finch robot. After a small introduction, you choose an exercise by showing a card with a number to Nao and it will assign a coding exercise to a student (but he/she only has to copy code). New exercises can be easily added.

## Installation
Just clone the repository and run main.py with Python 2.7

## Dependencies
- Python 2.7
- Nao libraries (already included)
- Finch libraries (already included)
- Camera software for the Nao robot (to test if the number image is being placed correctly)
